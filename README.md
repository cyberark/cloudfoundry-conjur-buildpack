The CyberArk Conjur Buildpack is a [decorator buildpack](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack#what-is-a-decorator) that provides convenient and secure access to secrets stored in Conjur.

The buildpack carries out the following:

+ Examines your app to determine the secrets to fetch using a [`secrets.yml`](https://cyberark.github.io/summon/#secrets.yml) file in the app root folder.
+ Utilizes credentials stored in your app's [`VCAP_SERVICES`](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) environment variable to communicate with the bound `cyberark-conjur` service.
+ The buildpack will authenticate using the aforementioned credentials, fetch the relevant secrets and inject them into the session environment variables at the start of the app. This means the secrets are only available to the app process.

Internally, the Conjur Buildpack uses [Summon](https://cyberark.github.io/summon/) to load secrets into the environment of CF-deployed applications based on the app's `secrets.yml` file.

## Requirements

+ The Conjur Buildpack requires the meta-buildpack. If you are unable to use the meta-buildpack (because you are using a custom buildpack, for example), see the [instructions below](#custom-buildpack-usage) for manually loading the buildpack scripts.

+ Ensure that your app is bound to a Conjur service instance. For more information on binding your application to a Conjur service instance, see the [Conjur Service Broker documentation](https://github.com/conjurinc/conjur-service-broker#binding-your-application-to-the-conjur-service)

+ A `secrets.yml` file exists within the root folder of your app

## How does the buildpack work ?

### `meta-buildpack`

`meta-buildpack` makes it possible to "decorate" the application with the ability to retrieve secrets on startup. Please read [`meta-buildpack` documentation](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack#how-it-works) for a quick run through of how `meta-buildpack` works.

`meta-buildpack` relies on automatic detection of the language buildpack. The first language buildpack in buildpack index order to detect and claim the build will be used to build the droplet and run the application. For `meta-buildpack` to be invoked, it must be at the top
of the buildpack index and your application must automatically detect the appropriate buildpack on `cf push`. If your application requires you to specify a buildpack on `cf push`, you can follow the [instructions for apps with custom buildpacks](#custom-buildpack-usage) to benefit from the convenience of the Conjur Buildpack without having to rely on the `meta-buildpack` for it to be invoked.

### Lifecycle scripts

The buildpack is comprised of the [3 lifecycle scripts](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack#how-to-write-a-decorator) that are required for decorator buildpacks.

+ Detect script always returns a non-zero exit status.
+ Compile script copies the `conjur-env` binary into your application's `vendor` directory and the `lib/0001_retrieve-secrets.sh` script into your application's `.profile.d` directory.
+ Decorate script returns a 0 when `secrets.yml` exists in the root folder of your app and the "cyberark-conjur" key is present in `VCAP_SERVICES`, otherwise non-zero exit status

The `.profile.d` script is responsible for retrieving secrets and injecting them into the session environment variables at the start of the app.

The buildpack has a cucumber test suite. This validates the functionality and also offers great insight into the intended functionality of the buildpack. Please see `./ci/features`.

## Getting Started

### Installing the Conjur Buildpack

**Before you begin, ensure you are logged into your CF deployment via the CF CLI.**

Install the [`meta-buildpack`](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack):
```
git clone git@github.com:cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack
cd meta-buildpack
./build
./upload
```

To install the Conjur Buildpack, download a ZIP of a release (at least version 1.x), unzip the release into its own directory, and run the `upload.sh` script:
```
mkdir conjur-buildpack
cd conjur-buildpack/
curl -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url | grep zip | awk '{print $NF}' | sed 's/",*//g') > conjur-buildpack.zip
unzip conjur-buildpack.zip
./upload.sh
```

Earlier versions of the Conjur Buildpack (v0.x) may be installed by cloning the repository and running `./upload.sh`.

### Buildpack Usage

#### Create a `secrets.yml` file

To use the Conjur Buildpack with a CF-deployed application, a `secrets.yml` file is required. The `secrets.yml` file gives a mapping of **environment variable name** to a **location where a secret is stored in Conjur**. For more information about creating this file, [see the Summon documentation](https://cyberark.github.io/summon/#secrets.yml). There are no sensitive values in the file itself, so it can safely be checked into source control.

The following is an example of a `secrets.yml` file

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: !var aws/$environment/iam/user/robot/access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: !var aws/$environment/iam/user/robot/secret_access_key
AWS_REGION: us-east-1
SSL_CERT: !var:file ssl/certs/private
```

The above example could resolve to the following environment variables:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
AWS_REGION: us-east-1
SSL_CERT: /tmp/ssl-cert.pem
```

#### Push with `meta-buildpack`

Before running `cf push`, ensure that:

+ `meta-buildpack` is installed and at the top of list of buildpacks
+ No buildpack is specified in your application's manifest
+ You will not specify a buildpack with the `-b` flag on `cf push`

If any of these conditions are not met, follow the [alternate usage directions](#custom-buildpack-usage) below.

Once you run `cf push`, assuming the app is bound to a Conjur service instance, the `meta-buildpack` will first invoke the appropriate language buildpack and then any decorator buildpacks (including the Conjur Buildpack). The secrets specified in the `secrets.yml` file will be available in the session environment variables at the start of the app.

#### <a name="custom-buildpack-usage"></a>Usage for users with custom buildpacks

To retrieve secrets without using `meta-buildpack` you can simply:

+ copy the contents of the `./lib` directory in a release to the `./.profile.d` directory relative to your app's root directory.
+ copy the contents of the `./vendor` directory in a release to the `./vendor` directory relative to your app's root directory.

When your application starts the secrets specified in the `secrets.yml` file will now be available in the session environment variables at the start of the app.

## Development

Before getting started, you should install some developer tools. These are not required to deploy the Conjur Service Broker but they will let you develop using a standardized, expertly configured environment.

1. [git][get-git] to manage source code
2. [Docker][get-docker] to manage dependencies and runtime environments
3. [Docker Compose][get-docker-compose] to orchestrate Docker environments

[get-docker]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation
[get-git]: https://git-scm.com/downloads
[get-docker-compose]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install

To test the usage of the Conjur Service Broker within a CF deployment, you can
follow the demo scripts in the [Cloud Foundry demo repo](https://github.com/conjurinc/cloudfoundry-conjur-demo).

To prepare to run the test suite on your local machine, call `./package.sh` to build the `summon` and `conjur-api-go` binaries and place them in the `vendor/` directory. Once you have done this, simply call `./test.sh`. The `test.sh` script will stand up the needed containers and run the full suite of rspec and cucumber tests.

When you generate a new release, run `./package.sh` to generate a new release ZIP file and upload the ZIP file to include it with the release.

### Updating the `summon` and `conjur-api-go` binaries

To update the versions of `summon` / `conjur-api-go` that are included in the buildpack, update to the appropriate version number in `conjur-env/Gopkg.toml`. To update `conjur-env/vendor/` and `conjur-env/Gopkg.lock`, start up a `conjur-env` container and run `dep ensure`:
```
$ docker-compose -f conjur-env/docker-compose.yml run --entrypoint bash conjur-env-builder
# dep ensure
```
You can verify that the correct dependencies are being used by running `dep status` from within the container before exiting and committing your changes.

Once you have done this, the next time `./package.sh` is run the `vendor/conjur-env` directory will be created with updated dependencies.
