The CyberArk Conjur Buildpack is a [supply buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/custom.html#contract) that provides convenient and secure access to secrets stored in Conjur.

The buildpack supplies scripts to your application that do the following:

+ Examine your app to determine the secrets to fetch using a [`secrets.yml`](https://cyberark.github.io/summon/#secrets.yml) file in the app root folder.
+ Retrieve credentials stored in your app's [`VCAP_SERVICES`](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) environment variable to communicate with the bound `cyberark-conjur` service.
+ Authenticate using the Conjur credentials, fetch the relevant secrets from Conjur, and inject them into the session environment variables at the start of the app. The secrets are only available to the app process.

## Requirements

+ Your app must be bound to a Conjur service instance. For more information on binding your application to a Conjur service instance, see the [Conjur Service Broker documentation](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-service-broker#bind-your-application-to-the-conjur-service)

+ Your app must have a `secrets.yml` file in its root directory when deployed

## How Does the Buildpack Work ?

The buildpack uses a [supply script](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/understand-buildpacks.html#supply-script) to copy files into the application's dependency directory under a subdirectory corresponding to the buildpack's index. The `lib/0001_retrieve-secrets.sh` script is copied into a `.profile.d` subdirectory so that it will run automatically when the app starts and the `conjur-env` binary is copied to a `vendor` subdirectory. In other words, your application will end up with the following two files:

```
- $DEPS_DIR/$BUILDPACK_INDEX/.profile.d/0001-retrieve-secrets.sh
- $DEPS_DIR/$BUILDPACK_INDEX/vendor/conjur-env
```

The `.profile.d` script is run automatically when the application starts and is responsible for retrieving secrets and injecting them into the app's session environment variables.

The `conjur-env` binary leverages the [Conjur Go API](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-api-go) and [Summon](https://github.com/cyberark/summon)
to authenticate with Conjur and retrieve secrets.

The buildpack has a cucumber test suite. This validates the functionality and also offers great insight into the intended functionality of the buildpack. Please see `./ci/features`.

## Getting Started

### Installing the Conjur Buildpack

**Before you begin, ensure you are logged into your CF deployment via the CF CLI.**

To install the Conjur Buildpack, download a ZIP of [the latest release](https://github.com/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/releases),
unzip the release into its own directory, and run the `upload.sh` script:
```
mkdir conjur-buildpack
cd conjur-buildpack/
curl -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/cyberark/cloudfoundry-conjur-buildpack/releases/latest | \
          jq .assets[0].browser_download_url | \
          sed 's/"//g') \
          > conjur-buildpack.zip
unzip conjur-buildpack.zip
./upload.sh
```

Earlier versions of the Conjur Buildpack (v0.x) may be installed by cloning the repository and running `./upload.sh`.

### Using the Conjur Buildpack

#### Create a `secrets.yml` File

For each application that will be using the Conjur Buildpack you must create a `secrets.yml` file. The `secrets.yml` file gives a mapping of **environment variable name** to a **location where a secret is stored in Conjur**. For more information about creating this file, [see the Summon documentation](https://cyberark.github.io/summon/#secrets.yml). There are no sensitive values in the file itself, so it can safely be checked into source control.

The following is an example of a `secrets.yml` file

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: !var aws/$environment/iam/user/robot/access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: !var aws/$environment/iam/user/robot/secret_access_key
AWS_REGION: us-east-1
SSL_CERT: !var:file ssl/certs/private
```

The above example could resolve to the following environment variables:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
AWS_REGION: us-east-1
SSL_CERT: /tmp/ssl-cert.pem
```

#### Invoke the Buildpack at Deploy Time

When you deploy your application, ensure it is bound to a Conjur service instance and add the Conjur Buildpack to your `cf push` command:

```
cf push my-app -b conjur-buildpack -b final-buildpack
```

When your application starts, the Conjur Buildpack will inject the secrets specified in the `secrets.yml` file into the application process as environment variables.
